## Introduction
This project is aim to create a **user-friendly business management solutions** for small and midsize enterprise (SME) using **Google Workspace and Apps Script**. Our group found that the **confidential mode on Gmail** can be improved, therefore we came out an idea to **add on view once feature**

## Problems
1.	Security Aspect
   - Private information can be exposed within the valid viewing time. Add on **View Once Feature** can increase the security of users
2.	Ineffective Advertising
   - In Business View: Bring Benefit for business as **View Once feature** can attract and stimulate users to spend to buy something by psychological approach. There is no second chance to buy the **promotion** goods
3.	Lack of Targeted Lead Generation
   - Many business struggle with the productivity of the products
   - Understand what users' needs and email to specific users in certain products or events by personalized engagement tactics
   - **View Once Feature** can increase the exposure rate and yield from the specific users
   
## Requirement
  -  Deal with the problem that SME faced in Google Workspace Tools
  -  Develop solutions by using Apps Script to create a prototype
